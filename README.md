# Hangman_GAME🎭✨
- Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. 
- One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. 
- Here I have created "Guess The City"_Edition of the same...you'll be having to guess the name of different cities randomly chose by the game.
## Technologies Used💎
 - Python3
## How It Works??🛠

- Every time you run the game a new random word is chosen to guess.
- You have only 6 chances to make wrong guesses.
